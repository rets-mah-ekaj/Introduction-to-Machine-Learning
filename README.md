# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

Hey! I have created this repo to understand Machine Learning. My source of knowledge for this course is https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning . This is an online learning platform I found and many coders around the world are appreciating this free platform a lot.

I hope you like it too. My Jupyter Notebook will be shared and will be in progress until I get the certification.

Thank you!
